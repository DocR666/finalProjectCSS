        <h1>Metal</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                I first fell down the rabbit hole of metal music through 'Chop Suey!' by System Of A Down, and the rest is history. 
                This is where the volume maxes out and the boundaries break down. Metal isn't just a genreâ€”it's a force. Whether it's 
                the thunder of double kicks, the growl of distorted guitars, or the raw emotion in every scream and solo, metal speaks
                a language I feel in my bones. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I listen to tons of metal music, and it's various sub-genres, so it was hard to pick a single winner, but in the end, I
                had to go back to my roots for this one. This was one of my gateway bands to metal, as I'm sure it was for many others.
                This artist has instilled the love for metal in multiple generations, and while a controversial album for metal elitists,
                this still contains some of their best work.
            </p>

                This album features the haunting 'The Unforgiven', the heavy drop-D riffs of 'Sad But True', and two of this artist's most famous
                tracks, 'Enter Sandman' and 'Nothing Else Matters'.
