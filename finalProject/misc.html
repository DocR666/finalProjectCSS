        <div>
            <p>
                Under the miscellaneous albums come the ones I couldn't group under the other categories, as there are various genres and
                sub-genres and I can't cover them all here.
            </p>

            <p>
                There was really one obvious choice here for me, this album was like nothing I had ever heard before and I am yet
                to dive into it's meaning and lore but it sure does seem interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every song on here is great in it's own way but my favourites include 'Two-Headed Boy' and the title track.
