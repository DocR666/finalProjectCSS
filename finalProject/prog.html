        <h1>Prog</h1>

            <p>
                Prog or progressive music is pushing a genre to its boundaries, and in cases even to new territories. 
                Prog is where music becomes exploration. It's the sound of breaking rules, stretching time, and building entire worlds 
                through sound. Whether it's the soaring epics of 70s prog rock or the crushing, intricate arrangements of modern prog 
                metal, these albums take me somewhere else, and often, challenge me as a guitarist.
                These records aren't background music. They're meant to be experiencedâ€”on headphones, in full, start to finish. 
                They're albums that changed how I think about structure and melody.
            </p>

            <p>
                While the album I have picked for this category is not exactly guitar-centric, it still holds a special place in my heart,
                and it is probably currently my favourite album.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could talk for hours about every single song on this album, but the stand-outs include the laid-back and lyrically
                technical 'Aqua Regia', the divine sounds of 'Vore', tbe 8 minute masterpiece of a title track, and what I believe is
                their magnum opus, 'The Summoning'.
