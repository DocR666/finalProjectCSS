        <h1>Classic Rock</h1>

            <p>
                Classic Rock is what really shaped my music taste. I started by listening to the legends; Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, AC/DC,
                and others.
                Classic rock is a genre that defined generations, blending powerful guitar riffs, poetic lyrics, and iconic vocals to create
                timeless music. Emerging in the 1960s and 70s with bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Beatles, classic rock 
                continues to influence artists across genres. Its raw energy and emotional depth resonate with listeners even today, making 
                it more than just a styleâ€”it's a lasting cultural movement.

                There are too many good choices, picking a favourite among these is like asking a parent to pick a favourite child. Ultimately
                however, one choice prevailed for me.

                With energetic tracks such as 'Rock and Roll', iconic riffs as in 'Black Dog', the blues-y ballad 'When the Levee Breaks'
                and the infamous 'Stairway to Heaven', this album takes the crown.
