        <h1>Electronic</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Before I started listening to rock and metal music I was deeply obsessed with electronic music and EDM. I was a huge
                sucker for bass and percussion, which I guess is what eventually led me to metal. Electronic music gives me a different 
                kind of escape, less about riffs, more about atmosphere, groove, and sonic textures. It's where precision meets emotion
                in the form of beats, glitches, loops, and layers.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have listened to tons of electronic music, but not much as albums, however, my pick is a fairly popular album
                by a decently famous electronic duo.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose this album over what is considered their best work, 'Discovery'. I have no particular reasoning for this, 
                I just vibed more with the songs on this album.
